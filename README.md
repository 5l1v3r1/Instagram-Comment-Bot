# InstagramCommentBot
##### Using selenium webdriver the bot creates an Instagram account than searches for desired account - clicks on first post - comments desired message

- **Features**
    - Uses proxys
    - Creates an account for you
    - Comments on posts

- **Generally since instagram is mean they wont let you create more than two account even when using a proxy**
    - Meaning you'll be banned from creating an account for a day
    - Also sometimes when the account get created instagram will ask for verfiation which just fucks everything
    
- **Running**
    - Of course with any python project you'll need to install the necessary packages etc
    - With the web driver for your browser in the current directory just run the script (I put the chrome one in the git repo but if you dont use chrome replace it https://selenium.dev/downloads/#client-drivers)
    - Make sure to change the account name and message in the script
